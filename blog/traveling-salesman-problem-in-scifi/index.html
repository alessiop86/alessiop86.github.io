<h1>Travelling Salesman Problem in sci-fi</h1>

<p>I recently stumbled upon <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/toast/toast-intro.html">Toast</a>,
a collection of sci-fi short stories by 3 times Hugo Award Winner (the most prestigious awards in the genre) Charles Stross, now out of print and released under the Creative Commons License.</p>

<p>I was particularly fascined by <em>Antibodies</em>, for its premise: the Travelling Salesman Problem has been solved in polynomial time, therefore it is the end of the world.</p>

<p>The Travelling Salesman Problem, described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Wikipedia</a> as <em>"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"</em>,
    is a problem pretty much ubiquitous in science, industry and also in everyday life (e.g. finding the most efficient path connecting pokèstops in your town while you are playing Pokèmon Go!).</p>

<p>How could a such seemingly harmless problem lead to the end of the world in "Antibodies"? Indirectly... more precisely since the TSP belongs<sup>*</sup> to the class of NP problems, and
theoretically every NP problem can be reduced to another problem of the same class of complexity, a polynomial time (in the story an astonishing O(n<sup>2</sup>))
solution for the TSP implies that P=NP, and that every NP problem could be solved in polynomial time. Just to make an example cryptography is doomed in a such scenario.</p>
<p>Oddly, while P=NP would come with some really positive consequences for the mankind, in Antibodies we only see the bad ones. Dystopian futures sells more books, probably...</p>
<p>Maybe I am just splitting hairs, because this is a fictional work after all, but I could not help but note that in the story we are told that
    <em>"someone's come up with a proof that NP-complete problems lie in P"</em>, but <strong>the TSP is not NP-complete but NP-hard</strong>,
    because given a solution you can't verify in polynomial time whether it is optimal or not. This mistake does not alter the "Antibodies" course of the story, in my opinion there is just a little inversion (solving the TSP in polynomial time would imply P=NP, but not the other way around).
</p></p>

<p>Inaccuracies aside, I strongly recommend the story because it's short, intriguing, and one of those sci-fi improbable-but-not-too-much scenarios that makes you think.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p>Final note: I just can't end this post without this TSP's comic strip from<a href="https://xkcd.com/399/">xkcd</a>: looks like selling on eBay outperforms the doomsday algorithm.</p>
