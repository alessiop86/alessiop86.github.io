        <p><strong>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</strong> is the first and probably the most famous book about the <strong>Design pattern</strong>. It was first published in 1995, but thankfully those design patterns are still valid nowadays, the only outdated thing in this book may be the <strong>Smalltalk</strong> programming language, used in some examples. Anyway this book is still very good and popular: in fact I have decided to read this book when, in a job listing, it was expressly requested the knowledge of design patterns and of this book!</p>
        <p>I will write a series of 15 articles about this book, making the summary of a couple chapters of this book in each one (the book is pretty big, it has over 500 pages). To deepen your knowledge of the argument, you can always buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=summarify-21" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=summarify-21', 'book @ Amazon');">book @ Amazon</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.it/e/ir?t=summarify-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=29&amp;a=0201633612" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; display: none !important;">.<br>

        <h1>The design patterns</h1>
        <p>The design patterns were born the moment in which some good software architects realised that making the <strong>perfect design</strong> at the first attempt was pretty  difficult if not impossible at all.</p>
        <p>The perfect design was supposed to be as flessible and as reusable as possible, unfortunately a such design was (almost) obtained after at least a couple of refactorization cycles: it was crucial to be abele to reuse good solution, what have worked in the past for the new projects.</p>
        <p>The design patterns are exactly this: they are “<strong>previous good solutions, applicable to a family of problems and situations with some traits in common”</strong>.<br>
            Four computer scientist collected the most used design patterns (as far as I know they did not really <em>invented</em> them), in a comprehensive book, that had become really popular in the subsequent years. Those computer scientist are now know as the <strong>Gang of Four</strong> or GoF, even if they do not even know exactly the reason, and the book is commonly referred to as “The Gang of Four Design Patterns”.</p>
        <h2>Are all the design patterns similar?</h2>
        <p>No. In fact they are divided by the Gang of Four in three groups, with different purposes. These groups are <em>Creational patterns, Structural patterns and Behavioral patterns</em>.</p>
        <h3>Creational patterns</h3>
        <p>They are related to the creation of objects. Each one amongst the pattern will be somewhen introduced in one of the articles of this series, now I will just list them:</p>
        <blockquote><p>Factory method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton</p></blockquote>
        <h3>Structural patterns</h3>
        <p>The structural patterns are related to the composition of classes or objects. They are:</p>
        <blockquote><p>Adapter, Bridge, COmposite, Decorator, Faced, Flyweight, Proxy</p></blockquote>
        <h3>Behavioral patterns</h3>
        <p>Those patterns regulate the interation between classes or objects. They are:</p>
        <blockquote><p>Interpreter, Templated Method, Chain of Reponsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor</p></blockquote>
        <h2>Principles behind the design patterns</h2>
        <p>The key is to <strong>program to an interface, not an implementation</strong>, trying whenever is possible <strong>to do not declare variables to be instances of particular concrete class</strong>. In this way the client remain unaware of the specific types of objects they use, they just refer to the interface.</p>
        <p>Another key principle is <strong>favor object composition over class inheritance</strong>, because the latter breaks encapsulation and can not be defined dynamically at run time, with dynamic references to other objects.</p>
        <p>The <strong>delegation</strong> is a way of empowering composition as far as concern the reusability. In delegation, each request to an object called is forwarded to another object, the <strong>delegate</strong>.</p>

        In the next article of this series, we will introduce the first Design Patterns, <strong>Composition</strong> and <strong>Strategy</strong>.<p></p>
        <p>If you want further information about the introduction to design pattern I have summarized in this article, I suggest you to purchase the GoF book in the <a href="http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=summarify-21" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3370&amp;creative=24114&amp;creativeASIN=0201633612&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=summarify-21', 'Amazon online store');">Amazon online store</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.it/e/ir?t=summarify-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=29&amp;a=0201633612" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; display: none !important;">.</p></section>
